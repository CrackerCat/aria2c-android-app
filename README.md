[ENGLISH](README.md) | [中文](README_zh_cn.md)

This is a version of aria2 on android. If you don't know what aria2 is, please check the following URL:

http://aria2.github.io/

The app is simple and only needs to be installed and ready to use after Google Play is downloaded.

</a>

On Google Play it costs $1.99. If you don't want to pay for the app, you can clone this source to build your own app. If you don't build an app, you can download the free version in the Coolapk market and they work exactly the same.

If you know the use of aria2 very well, then this app is very simple for you. You can find all the parameters you want to set in the advanced settings to optimize.

The app integrates the ability to automatically update trackers, so you don't have to be frustrated by the lack of speed on your BT torrent.

If you feel that this app is helpful to you, you can join in development, star me, or purchase on Google Play. Some suggestions or bugs can be submitted to the issue or contact me at the Coolapk market.

Here are some screenshots of the app for preview only.
